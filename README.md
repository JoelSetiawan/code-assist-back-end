Back-end for a web application that lets students upload and check assignment files - similar to Gradescope code autograder but with more functionality.

# TODO:

  # Flesh out a design of a web html file that allows the user to upload a file - User = Student
    # User does not need to know that we are uploading a file to a server where it is held and processed
    # User must not be able to access the file while it is being checked, otherwise they may be able to compromise the system.
      # Remember Security:  The Principle of Least Privilege and Sensible Defaults.
      
  # Learn how Apache Maven works.
  # Learn how to connect the hosted web server to Apache Maven
  # Learn how to connect a web html file to the shell commands that check that uploaded files meet the following libraries:
    # Check style
    # Compile error bugs
    # Build errors
    # Correct output - Diff checking
